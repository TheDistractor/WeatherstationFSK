WeatherstationFSK
=================

Refactored WeatherstationFSK based upon info@sevenwatt.com to run on ATTINY8&lt;4,5>

This is mainly just a few tweaks/refactor and reorg of same as above code driven by a few more defines
and an external include to make updates via git simpler. My aim was to get it onto a ATTINY84 to use 
this as a packet router as that MCU is capable enough. This will therefore now run on something like a 
TinyTX (http://nathan.chantrell.net/tinytx-wireless-sensor/)
JNu (http://jeelabs.org/2013/03/02/meet-the-jeenode-micro-v3/)
TinySensor (http://harizanov.com/wiki/wiki-home/tinysensor/)
or a DIY TINY board with RFM12b

Will try to squeeze mods made by others, like https://github.com/rinie/weatherstationFSK shortly, as 
only just noticed this repo.
